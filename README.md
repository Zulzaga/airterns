Git for Airterns
========

Git is core to nearly every company in tech right now. You cannot go wrong learning more about Git, and we would like as little friction to your bootup experience at Airbnb as possible. In fact, ideally, you should be committing code that goes live on your first or second day here.

And so to encourage some Git fluency from the very beginning, it is Git(hub) exercise time! If you're unfamiliar with Git, here's a place to start: https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-other-good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github

Please clone this repo and create a directory in the root named like your name with under_score formatting (so my directory would be `alex_davis`). It should have at least one file: an `about.txt` with a quick, public description of you that gives us a little bit of insight into who you are! Then pull request it; I will merge it in (and maybe even provide comments).

Totally optional: Bonus points if you later commit a [Codecademy Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) screenshot that looks like [this](http://screencast.com/t/tLl1V2ClW). If you haven't seen them, the Codecademy guides are great but very basic, so you should be able to breeze right through it even if you have never encountered Ruby before. Plus, its pretty fun.

Pull request your branch, and I will merge it in! Example: https://github.com/lxdvs/airterns/pull/1
